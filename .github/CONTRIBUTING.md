# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Axon JGiven. To make sure using Axon is a smooth experience for
everybody, we've set up a number of guidelines to follow.

There are different ways in which you can contribute to the framework:

  1. You can report any bugs, feature requests or ideas about improvements on GitHub: [https://github.com/holixon/axon-testing/issues/](https://github.com/holixon/axon-testing/issues/).
  All ideas are welcome. Please be as exact as possible when reporting bugs. This will help us reproduce and thus solve the problem faster.
  
  2. If you have created a component for your own application that you think might be useful to include in the framework, send us a pull request (or patch or a zip containing the source code). We will evaluate it and try to 
  fit it in the framework. Please make sure code is properly documented using KDoc. This helps us to understand what is going on.

## Code contributions

If you're contributing code, please take care of the following:

### Code style

We're trying very hard to maintain a consistent style of coding throughout the code base. Think of things like
indenting using 2 spaces, putting opening brackets (the '{') on the same line and putting proper KDoc on all
non-private members. There is an editorconfig file describing the main formatting issues and we use codacy to report 
errors in formatting and code style.
