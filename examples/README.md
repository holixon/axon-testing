# axon-testing examples

This module provides examples for using certain aspects of the
extension lib.

Since the extension is written in kotlin but should also be
"as usable as possible" within java projects, we should provide
an example matrix (kotlin with junit5, java with junit4, ...).

The `giftcard example common` can (but doesn't have to) be used for the different testing examples. It does not contain tests itself 
but reusing it avoids redundant code.
